# CI_Example

This repository serves as a demonstration of Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions. The workflow implemented here includes linting with Flake8 and testing with Python's unittest framework.

## Workflow Highlights

- **Linting**: The workflow uses Flake8 to identify and enforce Python syntax and style issues.
- **Testing**: Python unittests ensure the correctness of the codebase.
- **Branch Protection**: The `main` branch is protected, requiring developers to create feature branches and initiate pull requests for changes.

## Getting Started

To set up a similar CI workflow in your repository:

1. Click on "Actions" at the top of the repository to add a Python application workflow.
2. Customize the workflow YAML file based on the provided example in `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`.
3. Create a `tests.py` file containing your unittests.
4. Ensure proper linting and formatting using Flake8.
5. Implement branch protection for the `main` branch to require pull requests and approvals.

## Notes

- Ensure your repository is set up for the GitHub Student Developer Pack for enhanced features.
- Review and customize the workflow based on specific project requirements.
- Conduct code reviews during pull requests to maintain code quality.

For more details, refer to the documentation linked in the workflow YAML file.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this repository as a starting point for your projects!
